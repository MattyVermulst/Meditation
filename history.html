                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>The English word “meditation” stems from meditatum, a Latin term meaning “to ponder.” Although we
                    can’t know when,
                    exactly, people began to meditate, experts agree that the practice probably began many thousands of
                    years ago, before
                    the birth of modern civilization. When scholars look to establish the origins of meditation, they
                    first have to decipher
                    ancient texts and recorded hieroglyphs to find references to this discipline. Several archaeological
                    findings suggest
                    that hunter-gatherers were practitioners of some forms of meditation, as were early shamans. Their
                    knowledge was passed
                    down orally from one generation to the next, helping to lay the crucial foundations of modern
                    meditation.

                <h1>Western Meditation</h1>
                <p>Eastern philosophy caught the attention of western “seekers” and artists as early as the late 19th
                    century, but it
                    wasn’t until the mid-20th century that meditation became popularized in the West. This period saw
                    the arrival of
                    meditation masters from the East who were invited to share their skills and knowledge with
                    interested students. There
                    were also many western students of mindfulness who were able to travel east and train under great
                    masters in India,
                    Thailand, Burma and other Asian countries, then bring their understanding of mindfulness and
                    awareness practices back
                    home and share it.

                <h1>Eastern Influnce</h1>
                <p>Although many forms of meditation can be found in ancient religious traditions around the world, the
                    practice as a
                    formal component of a spiritual path is probably most closely associated with Buddhism. The Buddha,
                    who lived and taught
                    in Southeast Asia about 2600 years ago, founded an experiential path that inspired generations of
                    practitioners to sit
                    in mindful awareness and breathe their way to lasting peace. According to his teachings, meditative
                    concentration is one
                    of three trainings that when practiced together result in awakening, or enlightenment. The other two
                    are proper ethical
                    conduct and the wisdom of seeing things as they truly are.
